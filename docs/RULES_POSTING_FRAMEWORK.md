Below is a **posting rules framework** designed to be:

* **Legally defensive** (defamation-aware, platform-neutral)
* **Psychologically sound** (reduces pile-ons, exaggeration, and moral escalation)
* **User-friendly** (plain language, not lawyer-speak)

You can present this as **“Community Posting Guidelines”** or **“How to Share Responsibly”**.

# Posting Rules: How to Share Responsibly

This platform exists to help women make **informed, safer dating decisions** by sharing **personal dating experiences**. To keep the community fair, accurate, and safe for everyone, all posts must follow the rules below.

---

## 1. Share **Only Your Own Direct Experience**

✅ You may post:

* Things **you personally experienced**
* Interactions **you were part of**
* Information **the person directly told you**

🚫 Do not post:

* Rumors, hearsay, or “what I heard from a friend”
* Screenshots or stories from others
* Speculation about someone’s private life

**Rule of thumb:** If you weren’t there, don’t post it.

---

## 2. Stick to **What Happened**, Not **Who You Think They Are**

Please describe **specific actions or words**, not character judgments.

✅ Allowed:

* “He raised his voice when I didn’t respond right away.”
* “He said he was single, but I later learned he was in a relationship.”

🚫 Not allowed:

* “He’s abusive.”
* “He’s a narcissist.”
* “He’s a predator / creep / dangerous guy.”

**Why:** Labels and diagnoses can be misleading and legally risky. Actions are clearer and more helpful.

---

## 3. Use **First-Person, Time-Bound Language**

Your post should answer:

* When did this happen?
* How many dates or interactions?
* What exactly occurred?

✅ Example:

> “We went on two dates in March 2024. On the second date, he became upset when I said I wanted to go home early.”

🚫 Avoid:

* Vague timelines
* “He always…” or “He never…”
* Statements that imply permanent traits

---

## 4. No Medical, Psychological, or Criminal Claims

Unless something is **public record and legally established**, do not make claims about:

🚫 Diagnoses (e.g., narcissist, sociopath)
🚫 Criminal behavior (e.g., abuser, rapist, predator)
🚫 Intentions or motives (e.g., “he targets women,” “he manipulates everyone”)

Instead, explain **what made you uncomfortable** or **why you chose not to continue dating**.

---

## 5. Dating Overlap Is Allowed — Accusations Are Not

You may share factual information about dating overlap.

✅ Allowed:

* “He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else, but I later learned he was dating multiple people.”

🚫 Not allowed:

* Accusing someone of cheating, lying, or wrongdoing without clear, personal evidence
* Calling someone immoral for dating multiple people

---

## 6. No Calls for Punishment or Harassment

🚫 Do not:

* Encourage others to confront, report, harass, or “expose” someone
* Suggest contacting their workplace, family, or social media
* Use threatening or mocking language

This platform is **not** a court, investigation, or accountability campaign.

---

## 7. Be Aware Your Post May Be Read by the Person Involved

Posts should be written as if:

* The person could see it
* A moderator or third party could review it
* It might be interpreted literally, not emotionally

This helps keep the space respectful and credible.

---

## 8. Moderation & Edits

To protect the community:

* Posts may be edited or removed if they violate these rules
* Moderators may ask you to rewrite a post using neutral, experience-based language
* Repeated violations may result in posting restrictions

Moderation is based on **how something is written**, not whether your feelings are valid.

---

## 9. One Experience ≠ A Full Picture

Everyone’s experience is personal and may differ from others’.
Posting here does **not** mean a final judgment about someone.

---

## Final Reminder

This space works best when posts are:

* **Specific**
* **Factual**
* **First-person**
* **Non-judgmental**

Clear experiences help others. Labels and speculation do not.

---

### Optional Add-On (Highly Recommended)

At the point of posting, require users to check:

* ☐ This is my personal experience
* ☐ I am describing actions, not assigning diagnoses or intent
* ☐ I understand this post may be reviewed or moderated

---

Below is a **tone-aware auto-rewrite system** that is legally defensive, psychologically calming, and easy for users to accept with **one tap**.

This is written as **UX copy + logic + examples**, so product, legal, and moderation teams can all align.

---

## 1. How It Appears to the User (Microcopy)

When the system detects risky language, a non-judgmental banner appears **before posting**:

> **Want help making this clearer and safer?**
> We can rewrite this to focus on what happened, not labels or assumptions.

**[Review Suggested Rewrite]**  **[Post Anyway]**

No scolding. No “violation” language. Choice is preserved.

---

## 2. The One-Tap Rewrite Promise (Very Important)

At the top of the rewrite modal:

> **This rewrite keeps your experience intact — it only adjusts wording for clarity and fairness.**

Psychologically, this reduces resistance and defensiveness.

---

## 3. Core Rewrite Rules (Invisible to Users)

The system automatically:

* Converts **labels → behaviors**
* Converts **certainty → subjectivity**
* Converts **accusations → personal impact**
* Removes **diagnostic / criminal language**
* Anchors statements in **time and context**

The *facts* stay. The *tone* changes.

---

## 4. Example Auto-Rewrites (User-Facing)

### Example A — Diagnostic Language

**Original**

> “He’s a narcissist and emotionally abusive. Huge red flag.”

**Suggested Rewrite**

> “On our third date (April 2024), he dismissed my feelings when I tried to set boundaries, which made me uncomfortable and led me to stop seeing him.”

**Why this works**

* Keeps the warning
* Removes diagnosis
* Grounds it in time and behavior

---

### Example B — Criminal / Dangerous Language

**Original**

> “This guy is dangerous. Avoid at all costs.”

**Suggested Rewrite**

> “During our first date (June 2024), he ignored my request to leave and continued pressuring me to stay, which made me feel unsafe.”

---

### Example C — Gossip / Pile-On Language

**Original**

> “Everyone knows he lies and dates tons of girls.”

**Suggested Rewrite**

> “He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else, but I later learned he was dating multiple people at the same time.”

---

### Example D — Motive Attribution

**Original**

> “He manipulates women to get what he wants.”

**Suggested Rewrite**

> “In my experience, he changed his behavior after I expressed interest in something serious, which felt misleading to me.”

---

## 5. The Rewrite Modal (Minimal & Mobile-Friendly)

**Title:**
**Suggested Rewrite**

**Body:**

> We’ve adjusted the wording to focus on what you experienced and keep it factual.

(Shows side-by-side or just the rewritten version, depending on UI constraints)

**Buttons:**
✅ **Use This Version**
✏️ **Edit Manually**
❌ **Cancel**

Default focus is on **Use This Version**.

---

## 6. Language the System Specifically Targets

The auto-rewrite triggers on:

* Absolute claims: *always, never, everyone*
* Labels: *abusive, narcissist, predator, creep*
* Moral judgments: *evil, disgusting, trash*
* Calls to action: *avoid him, warn everyone*

But it **does not** rewrite:

* Descriptions of actions
* Emotional impact (“I felt unsafe”)
* Decisions (“I stopped seeing him”)

This preserves trust.

---

## 7. Optional Line Added to Rewrites (Highly Recommended)

At the end of rewritten posts, automatically append (small text):

> *This reflects one person’s experience.*

This single line dramatically reduces legal interpretation risk.

---

## 8. Why This Works (Strategically)

* **Users feel helped, not censored**
* **Moderators deal with fewer escalations**
* **Plaintiffs’ attorneys see restraint and good faith**
* **Tone normalization prevents culture drift into gossip**

Most importantly:
Users still feel *heard* — just not weaponized.

---

## 9. One Hard Rule (Internal)

If a user repeatedly refuses rewrites and posts inflammatory language:

* Require rewrites before posting
* Don’t argue, don’t moralize
* Frame it as *formatting*, not punishment

---
