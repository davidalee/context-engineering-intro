Below is a **side-by-side comparison** showing how *small wording choices* radically change legal risk, tone, and user behavior — **without reducing engagement**.

I’ll be blunt about *why the bad copy fails* and *why the good copy works*.

---

# 1. Entry Point: “Why Are You Posting?”

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                   | ✅ **Good Copy**                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Warn other women**             | **Share a personal dating experience** |
| *Signals moral duty + certainty* | *Signals subjectivity + narrative*     |
| Invites exaggeration             | Invites description                    |

**Why bad copy is dangerous:**
It primes users to *protect others*, which justifies certainty and escalation. Courts read this as intent to accuse.

# 2. Writing Prompt

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                   | ✅ **Good Copy**                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| “What red flags did you notice?” | “What stood out during your interaction?” |
| Assumes wrongdoing               | Allows neutral observation                |
| Encourages labeling              | Encourages facts                          |

**Psychological effect:**
“Red flags” pushes users into pattern-matching and confirmation bias.

# 3. Emotional Expression Field

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                | ✅ **Good Copy**                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| “Why was this person unsafe?” | “How did this experience affect you?” |
| Forces conclusion             | Preserves feelings without verdict    |
| High defamation risk          | Low legal risk                        |

This is a **critical reframing**. Feelings ≠ facts — and courts understand that.

# 4. Guidance Copy (Hidden vs Helpful)

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                    | ✅ **Good Copy**                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Do not post defamatory content.” | “Focus on what happened, not why you think it happened.” |
| Legal threat tone                 | Writing advice tone                                      |
| Triggers reactance                | Encourages cooperation                                   |

**Mediator insight:**
People comply more with *craft advice* than *rule enforcement*.

# 5. Confirmation Step Before Posting

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                            | ✅ **Good Copy**                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| “I certify this information is accurate.” | “This reflects my personal experience.” |
| Invites false certainty                   | Signals subjectivity                    |
| Legally risky                             | Legally protective                      |

Never ask users to swear to “truth.” Ask them to own perspective.

# 6. Post Header Label

| ❌ **Bad Copy**      | ✅ **Good Copy**                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🚩 **Warning**      | **Unverified personal experience** |
| Feels official      | Feels individual                   |
| Implies endorsement | Implies distance                   |

**This label alone can change how a jury reads your platform.**

# 7. Multiple Reports Indicator

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                            | ✅ **Good Copy**                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ⚠️ “Multiple women warned about this man” | “Multiple members have shared personal experiences involving this individual.” |
| Accusatory                                | Descriptive                                                                    |
| Verdict-like                              | Data-like                                                                      |

**Important:**
Never combine *count* + *judgment* in the same sentence.

# 8. Comment Prompt

| ❌ **Bad Copy**           | ✅ **Good Copy**                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| “Is this guy dangerous?” | “Add context or share your own experience.” |
| Invites pile-on          | Invites parallel narratives                 |
| Escalates harm           | Distributes perspective                     |

# 9. Moderator Intervention Message

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                   | ✅ **Good Copy**                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Your post violates our policy.” | “We’re asking for a small edit so your experience can stay visible.” |
| Punitive                         | Collaborative                                                        |
| Triggers hostility               | Preserves goodwill                                                   |

**Retention difference:** dramatic.

# 10. App Store / Marketing Copy

| ❌ **Bad Copy**                       | ✅ **Good Copy**                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Expose cheaters and dangerous men.” | “Share dating experiences to make more informed choices.” |
| Provocative                          | Credible                                                  |
| Short-term growth                    | Long-term survival                                        |

## The Meta-Pattern (This Is the Lesson)

Bad copy:

* Assigns **motive**
* Implies **certainty**
* Frames posts as **warnings or verdicts**

Good copy:

* Anchors in **experience**
* Signals **uncertainty**
* Frames posts as **personal narratives**

> **You don’t reduce engagement by removing judgment.
> You reduce lawsuits.**

## One Sentence Rule (If You Remember Nothing Else)

> **If a sentence sounds like it belongs in a courtroom accusation, rewrite it until it sounds like a diary entry.**

---

If you want, next I can:

* Rewrite *existing* copy you’re using now
* Stress-test copy against a hypothetical defamation claim
* Create an internal checklist for copywriters & moderators
* Adapt this for international legal contexts

Just tell me.
