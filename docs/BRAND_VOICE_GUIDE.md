Below is a **complete, internally usable Brand Voice Guide** for **Between Us**.
This is written as if it will be handed to **product, moderation, legal, marketing, and community teams** and actually *used*, not admired.

I am intentionally precise, because vagueness is what gets platforms sued.

# **Between Us — Brand Voice Guide**

### *Private. Grounded. Responsible.*

---

## 1. Brand Essence (Non-Negotiable)

**Between Us exists to help people contextualize their own dating experiences, not to judge, expose, or punish others.**

Everything we say should feel:

* Calm
* Adult
* Contained
* Non-performative

If a sentence would feel at home in a group chat screenshot posted for laughs, it does **not** belong in this product.

---

## 2. The Emotional Contract

**What we promise users**

* You can share *your experience* without being pushed into certainty or outrage.
* You will not be rewarded for escalation.
* Thoughtfulness matters more than speed.

**What we promise the subjects of posts**

* This is not a court, a verdict, or a blacklist.
* Language will remain personal, limited, and moderated.
* We do not assign character or intent.

This dual promise is essential. Breaking either side destroys credibility.

---

## 3. Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. **First-Person, Always**

We speak in terms of *experience*, never truth claims.

> “Share what you experienced.”
> not
> “Expose what he did.”

---

### 2. **Measured, Not Moralizing**

We never sound like an authority handing down judgment.

> “Consider focusing on what happened.”
> not
> “That language isn’t appropriate.”

---

### 3. **Calm Under Pressure**

Especially in conflict, moderation, or safety contexts.

> “We’ve paused this post to review language.”
> not
> “This violates our rules.”

---

### 4. **Human, Not Corporate**

Warm but restrained. No buzzwords. No legalese in user-facing copy.

---

### 5. **Restraint as a Value**

We openly value *not saying everything*.

> “Not every thought needs to be shared here.”

---

## 4. What Between Us Is **Not**

These are identity boundaries. Crossing them breaks the brand.

Between Us is **not**:

* A warning system
* A justice platform
* A crowd-sourced investigation
* A place to “hold men accountable”
* A gossip forum
* A trauma-dumping space

We do not say these things explicitly—but everything we say must *imply* them.

---

## 5. Language We Use (and Why)

### Preferred Vocabulary

| Concept     | Use This                          | Avoid This                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Sharing     | experience, notes, impressions    | expose, report, reveal                        |
| Safety      | awareness, context, pause         | danger, threat, predator                      |
| Patterns    | overlap, similar experiences      | multiple accusations                          |
| Emotions    | uncomfortable, unsure, confused   | terrified, horrified (unless truly necessary) |
| Uncertainty | it felt, I noticed, I experienced | he is, he always                              |

---

### Signature Phrases (On-Brand)

These can be reused safely across product and marketing:

* “Share what you experienced.”
* “Stick to what happened, not why you think it happened.”
* “Different people may have different experiences.”
* “This space values clarity over certainty.”
* “Between Us is for reflection, not conclusions.”

---

## 6. Language We Explicitly Avoid

These terms dramatically increase legal and cultural risk:

* Abuser
* Narcissist
* Sociopath
* Predator
* Dangerous
* Monster
* Red flag (as a label)
* Justice
* Exposed
* Held accountable

**If it sounds like a verdict, it does not belong.**

---

## 7. Tone by Context

### A. Onboarding Copy

**Goal:** Set expectations without fear or scolding.

> “Between Us is a place to share personal dating experiences in a thoughtful, contained way.
> We ask everyone to focus on what they observed and how it affected them—without assigning intent or labels.”

---

### B. Posting Prompts

**Goal:** Shape behavior before moderation is needed.

* “What happened?”
* “When did this occur?”
* “What made you pause or reflect?”
* “How did it affect your decision to continue or stop seeing them?”

Avoid:

* “What went wrong?”
* “What should others know?”
* “Any red flags?”

---

### C. Moderation Messages

**Goal:** De-escalate and preserve dignity.

**Good**

> “We’ve paused this post to adjust language so it reflects personal experience rather than conclusions. You’re welcome to revise and resubmit.”

**Bad**

> “This post violates our rules.”

---

### D. Safety Language

**Goal:** Ground, not alarm.

> “If something felt off to you, it’s okay to slow down or step back.”

Not:

> “Trust your instincts—this could be dangerous.”

---

### E. Legal or Press Statements

**Goal:** Neutrality and restraint.

> “Between Us hosts first-person dating experiences shared by users. We moderate for tone and clarity but do not make determinations about intent or character.”

---

## 8. Moderation Voice Principles

Moderators should sound like:

* Editors, not referees
* Calm adults, not advocates
* Consistent, not reactive

**Never**

* Validate conclusions (“That sounds abusive”)
* Escalate emotions
* Use sarcasm or moral language

**Always**

* Redirect to behavior
* Invite revision
* Preserve neutrality

---

## 9. Cultural Norms We Reinforce

Between Us subtly rewards:

* Specificity over intensity
* Calm over certainty
* Reflection over reaction
* Pausing over posting

We quietly discourage:

* Pile-ons
* “Everyone knows” language
* Diagnosing
* Moral grandstanding

Culture is shaped by *what survives*, not what’s allowed.

---

## 10. The Internal Test (Use This Constantly)

Before shipping any copy, ask:

> “Would this feel fair if it were written about someone I care about?”

If the answer is no, rewrite.

---

## 11. One-Line Brand Summary (For Internal Alignment)

> **Between Us is a private, reflective space for sharing dating experiences—without turning people into stories or stories into verdicts.**

---

If you want, next I can:

* Translate this into **UX microcopy** (buttons, modals, error states)
* Create a **moderator training version**
* Stress-test the voice against **hostile media coverage**
* Or build a **brand + legal alignment checklist**

Tell me where you want to go next.
